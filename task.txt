1)->HTTP 1.1

* There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
* It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
* It compresses data by itself.

->HTTP 2
* nIt works on the binary protocol.
* It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

2) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
* Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

* Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
